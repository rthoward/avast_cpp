# Actors

Actors are the main entities of the game. Monsters, NPCs and the Player are all
actors. 

## Actors and the Game Engine

The game engine stores a list of all actors which is used in both rendering and
logic. The Map class has methods which allows one to query the positions of
different actors and the tiles that they inhabit.

## Actor Capabilities

Actors are the most important aspect of the game, as well as the most complex.
Because of their wide range of actions, it makes sense to separate their
capabilities in a modular way. I did this using composition.

Any given actor may have up to (currently) 3 components which determine its
behavior:

   * __Attacker__: determines how actors attack, as well as their power
   * __Defender__: determines defense and death
   * __AI__: movement logic, aggression, pathfinding, etc
